# Virtual Insurance Agent using LangChain and Together AI
This document outlines the implementation of a virtual insurance agent using LangChain and Together AI. The agent is designed to answer insurance-related questions based on a knowledge base derived from insurance exam documents.

## Setup and Dependencies:

Libraries:
- **LangChain:** A framework for building and deploying language models. It provides tools for data loading, preprocessing, vector store creation, and chain building.
- **LangChain-Experimental:** Offers experimental features and extensions for LangChain.
- **LangChain-Community:** Provides community-contributed modules and integrations for LangChain.
- **LangChain-OpenAI:** Enables integration with OpenAI's language models.
- **OpenAI:** Provides access to OpenAI's API, including language models like GPT-3.
- **ChromaDB:** A vector database for storing and querying embedded representations of data.
- **PyPDFLoader:** A library for loading PDF documents.
- **SentenceTransformers:** A library for generating sentence embeddings.
- **Gradio:** A library for creating user interfaces for machine learning models.
- **LangChain-Together:** Enables integration with Together AI's language models.
- **Together AI:** A platform for running open-source language models.
- **Purpose:**
These libraries provide the necessary tools for building and deploying the virtual insurance agent, including data loading, preprocessing, vector store creation, chain building, and user interface development.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing:

- Load insurance exam documents from a designated directory using the PyPDFDirectoryLoader.
- Split the loaded documents into smaller chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to facilitate processing and indexing.
## Vector Store Creation:

- Generate sentence embeddings for the document chunks using the SentenceTransformerEmbeddings library.
- Create a Chroma vector store to index the embedded representations of the document chunks.
## Building the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Chain:

- Initialize a Together AI LLM using the Together library.
- Create a retriever based on the Chroma database, filtering results based on a similarity score threshold.
- Define a prompt template to guide the LLM in generating informative and concise answers.
- Construct a RetrievalQA chain that combines the LLM, retriever, and prompt template to enable question answering based on the knowledge base.
## User Interaction and Response Generation:

- Process user queries using the **RAG chain.**
- Retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base and generate responses using the LLM.
Format the responses in Markdown for better readability.

## Future Work:

- **Expand Knowledge Base:** Incorporate additional insurance-related documents to enhance the agent's knowledge.
- **Improve User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the agent.
- **Implement Dialogue History:** Track the conversation history to provide more context-aware responses.
- **Integrate with External Systems:** Connect the agent with external systems to provide real-time information and facilitate transactions.
- **Explore Other LLM Models:** Experiment with different LLM models to improve the agent's accuracy and fluency.
- **Develop a Data Pipeline and Training Framework:** Create a framework for continuously training the agent on new data and feedback.
# Conclusion:

This document provides a high-level overview of the implementation of a virtual insurance agent using LangChain and Together AI. The agent leverages a knowledge base built from insurance exam documents, enabling it to answer insurance-related questions effectively. The use of a RAG chain allows for accurate and context-aware responses, enhancing the user experience. This approach can be further extended to incorporate additional features and functionalities, making the virtual insurance agent a valuable tool for both individuals and insurance companies.
